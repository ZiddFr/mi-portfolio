# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

-- DO. THE. RESPONSIVE. DESIGN. IT'S. NOT. THAT. HARD.  --

- To-do:
- Solve expired session: After user session has expired while the tab is closed, opening again will lead to an incorrect unload of some components.
- Cards style: do some stylish things to the tags(H2, P)/divs to stop resising the card.
- displayProdut: don't have it style the whole doc yet.

- pageTheme.jsx: Not yet implemented. Some problems updating the pageTheme structure after login/logout session.

- Connect my own DB: Still working on my -Java-mysql-ReactJS- project.
--- I'll copy the structure of the dummyjson database (not all)
-- Users data: Need fake photos, write so much text, invent some predefined users data (id, full name, username, password, email, etc.)
-- Producst data: photos of products, rate, stock...
